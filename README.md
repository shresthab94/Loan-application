## **Loan Analyzer** :

<span style="color: blue">
The application is an part of a loan facilitating software that helps the user to create a list of banks that would be congruent to their home application loan.

<br>

Based on credit score, income, property valuation, and the amount of debt that the user requests the application will compile a list of banks, along with different respective informations. Moreover, the user can save the list in an externala file so that it can be used for other purposes as well.
</br>

The application is very interactive as it takes financial informations that banks base their loan information from the user itself to make imporatant valuation. This allows the user to make adjustments. Similarly, the option to save the list would enable the user to export the information to other people like their spouse, family members, realtors, or financial advisors.

## The Application
<p>

<span style="color: red">
The application filters through the different options of bank loans from different banks based on income, required loan, house price, and credit score of an individual user. Similarly, the application allows the user to generate the list of possible bank loans that the individual could possible appy for based on his financial needs and capabilities.

<br>

The aim of the application is to ease the already complicated loan application process. Since, the application computes its evaluations based on the core financial information that the banks use, it narrows downs the list to potential loan application; hence, saving time and effort of the user ensuring the best outcomes.
